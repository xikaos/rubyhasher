# rubyhasher
A simple script I did to train my Ruby skills. Consider the scenerio where you have to check the integrity of important files. This little guy can help you, if you need to do it for a lot of files and they are in the same directory.
The hashing algorithm used is SHA2 256 bits.
The output can be changed from YAML to JSON via commenting/uncommenting lines, cause it looks fancy, doesn't it :-D?

##Usage##
1 - Run the script invoking the Ruby interpreter along with the path where the main.rb file is located:
```
ruby ~/Downloads/rubyhasher/main.rb
```
2 - The program will prompt for further interaction.
