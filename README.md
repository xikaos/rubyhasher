# rubyhasher
A simple script I did to train my Ruby skills. Consider the scenerio where you have to check the integrity of important files. This little guy can help you, if you need to do it for a LOT of files in the same directory.
##Usage##
1 - Run the script invoking the Ruby interpreter along with the path where the main.rb file is located:
```
ruby ~/Downloads/rubyhasher/main.rb
```
2 - The program will prompt for further interaction.
